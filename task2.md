Please read the following passage, taken from an online forum. (2/5)

{: .quote}
My (admittedly) strong bias is against both pro-legalization and anti-legalization forces because they're essentially fighting for position, and the real crime here is overall apathy toward the issue. If people were to say, "I'm for legalization, and here's why..." or "I'm against legalization, and here's why..." I wouldn't be upset at all. However, when people aren't willing to even admit that there may be a legitimate case to be made for one side or the other, it's hard to think of stupider uses of my time than to listen to them and try to read their rambling thoughts.
