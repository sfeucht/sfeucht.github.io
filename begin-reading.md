title: Rereading Writing
---

The following five texts have been selected from a large corpus that was created by cognitive scientists in order to study different approaches to <b>argumentation</b>. 

Each of these documents is a randomly-sampled comment from an online forum in which users discuss legalization of cannabis and other drugs. 

These documents vary in terms of coherence: many are badly written and difficult to understand, and would be rated as having low argument quality. 

Please read and respond to each of these five texts as you see fit. There are some questions to guide you.
