April 24, 2025 • &lt;span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(I think that we overvalue logical reasoning when it comes to measuring &amp;ldquo;intelligence.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the books that I remember reading this year. I don&amp;rsquo;t set reading goals for myself, but this year a lot of interesting books fell into my lap. I even managed to have time to read many of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;East, West - Salman Rushdie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If This Is a Man - Primo Levi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to Do Things with Words - JL Austin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lolita - Vladimir Nabokov&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing Further - Esther Kinsky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Empusium - Olga Tokarczuk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Childish Literature - Alejandro Zambra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ways of Paradise - Peter Cornell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attached - Amir Levine and Rachel S. F. Heller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- ### East, West - Salman Rushdie.

My partner Adrian bought this from a bin in Harvard Square. I found it delightful, and will be looking for more Salman Rushdie in the future. 

**If This Is a Man - Primo Levi.** Lent to me by my friend Raj. 

**How to do things with words - JL Austin.** Lent to me by my advisor David. Makes me want to read Judith Butler. 

**Lolita - Nabokov.** One of the best novels I&#39;ve read so far, ever. 

**Seeing Further - Esther Kinsky.** Gift from my partner (first book from a Fitzcarraldo Editions subscription). 

**The Empusium - Olga Tokarczuk.** 

**Childish Literature - Alejandro Zambra.**

**The Ways of Paradise - Peter Cornell.**

**Attached - Amir Levine and Rachel S. F. Heller.**  --&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;&gt; May 3, 2025 - A short story about high schoolers. Congrats if you found this page. &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/manny.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF Version&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man (Manny) is a kid in my grade. How do I explain him to you? Well, first, he was born in 2001. This means, like me, he is sixteen years old. He mains Fox. His outward temperament is soft, but his insides are littered with naval mines. He is the only person I have ever loved. Oh, and just like me, he loves &lt;code&gt;MEME&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;code&gt;MEME&lt;/code&gt;—that is a good place to start. Two years ago after Labour Day, I sat beneath a window of cold autumn light. I was fourteen at the time. A muffin wrapper filled with jelly beans lay on the laminate table. The jellies reminded me of &lt;code&gt;THE BEAN MEME&lt;/code&gt;, and I needed this fact to be known.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“They’re just putting beans anywhere now, huh?” I quipped. I heard a snort behind me and turned to see the corners of Man’s mouth lift.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“I saw that &lt;code&gt;MEME&lt;/code&gt;,” he said with a hint of pride. His eyes were still fixed on the cup of candy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“It’s a &lt;code&gt;DANK&lt;/code&gt; one,” I said. He looked up, and I noticed for the first time that his irises were dark green. “I don’t think I caught your name?” &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“Sorry, yeah, I’m Manny. Or Man, whichever is easier.” &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“Okay. I’m Zain!” I wanted to say, &lt;em&gt;Man is easier, because that’s what you are, a huMan,&lt;/em&gt; but thankfully I was a moment too late, and the quip was lost to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syllabi were passed around the room, and that was the extent of my interactions with Man on the day after Labour Day. This was mainly because neither of us knew how to ask someone else about themselves. As I walked home that afternoon, the sky was clear and cold. It had been a number of hours since I’d eaten the beans; I wondered where in my body the glucose and dye had ended up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t say that I have no friends, because I do have friends by most metrics. Lucas, who was my lockermate in Grade 6. Amos, a Marth main who hates math. But I don’t think that these are close friends. When Amos shaved his head for charity, I watched from the atrium windows. I’ve never been to Lucas’ house. My mom has never met either set of parents. But I never say that I have no friends, because that is graceless. I eat lunch with them most days. What else do you call the people you lunch with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, Manny was my first real friend. While it took years to know Amos and Lucas, it took weeks to know him. After a few lonely attempts at gathering like terms, I would turn around to show Manny a watermarked &lt;code&gt;MEME&lt;/code&gt;, at which he would chuckle to signal his understanding of its depth; a warm reprieve from polynomial limbo for us both. My eyes would slide away from the phone screen, just in time to see Man’s flit down towards his papers. I had never met someone else who knew about &lt;code&gt;THE BEAN MEME&lt;/code&gt;. That was the difference between him and Marina, my previous deskmate and Grade 8 crush. &lt;em&gt;Marina never understood dank,&lt;/em&gt; I would reflect quietly. &lt;em&gt;Not like Manny does. Girls typically do not grasp the subtle qualities of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;EDGY HUMOUR&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I could be &lt;code&gt;EDGY&lt;/code&gt; with Manny. We were two teenage boys, after all! Once, I said the word “kinky,” and it made him laugh to tears. Together, we enjoyed fake salutes and ironic hot dogs. And every time I made him laugh, I felt blood in my cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s lunchtime in mid-October. I reach over outstretched legs to get to my locker. It’s embarrassing to eat in the hallways, but I don’t know where else to go, so I sit and look at Amos’ laptop, over his shoulder. But today was a special day. Manny fluttered in and kneeled across from me, back to the cinderblock, with his black Adidas pants folded up like the wings of a magpie. He was uncharacteristically forward, but his voice was as soft as always.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“Do you like calligraphy?” &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;I don’t know what to say to this! I’ve never thought about calligraphy in my life. It’s old-person and gay at the same time. But&amp;hellip; “Yes?”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;His corvid eyes sparkled. “You should come to the art room today, they’re doing a calligraphy thing!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t exactly know what that means, but I stuff my Tupperware back into my bag and zip it up as we walk downstairs together&amp;ndash;just the two of us, since Amos and Lucas were not interested. Manny walks with a lilt, almost like he’s skipping down the stars. My throat felt slightly dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calligraphy itself was fine. You were supposed to be gentle but firm with the pen. I must have pressed too hard: I kept puncturing the white paper with my nib, scraping fibres away from the pink construction paper underneath. Manny carefully filled his paper with identical lowercase “a”s. For the first time, I sat next to him, instead of in front of him. As he carefully carved calligraphy “a”s, I reflected on his other lettering&amp;hellip; the way that he wrought algebraic variables, curvy-like. The sharp, blue-blue pencil that he used to point out my mistakes, as if he was carefully holding my hand as we crossed a creek. Yeah, he was smarter than me, and harder-working, but he was so soft and shy. Why did he keep practicing the letter “a”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glancing over the other white sheafs, I noticed that his friends (girls he met through Drama who I didn’t really know) had already started writing real messages. None of them talked to me. They actually didn’t look at me at all, even when I cleared my throat. It could have been that they just loved lettering that much. Or, they were wondering what an &lt;code&gt;EDGY&lt;/code&gt; guy like me was doing in the mostly-female art room at lunch. I wasn’t autistic enough to break out the &lt;code&gt;MEMES&lt;/code&gt; in front of them, but I did spend the last ten minutes of lunch writing a number of uppercase “F”s (a subtle nod to the &lt;code&gt;PAY RESPECTS MEME&lt;/code&gt;). Manny didn’t seem to catch my reference, so we just parted with a “that was cool, see you on Thursday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an analogy from simple machines: if all the events in my sixteen years of life were placed chronologically along a long piece of plywood and I needed to pick a location for a fulcrum, its plastic head would point to the moment when I sat down next to Manny at the calligraphy workshop. That was the first time I &lt;em&gt;smelled&lt;/em&gt; him. Green apples and clean dark hair. From that moment on, I was cursed to smell Manny’s Head and Shoulders everywhere: on the third floor, on the ground floor, in stacks of dusty textbooks, above the slush between the two sets of main doors, in my jacket and my papers, when he was at school, and especially when he was not. It was ambrosia. As an adolescent, there was of course a sexual aspect to my obsession. Manny was small, like a wren, with dark brows and ceramic hands. But he also laughed at my MEMEs, and we would play Smash together, and he would &lt;em&gt;come up&lt;/em&gt; to me at lunch. He would come up to me. He wanted to talk to me! I thought about him at night, but I also wanted to cup him in my hands. I wanted to stroke the top of his head with the backs of my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fixation spanned semesters. Weeks upon months of online quizzes and unsatisfactory porn. I figured that enough rolls of the dice (of asking “does he like me?”) would reveal his internals. Upon later reflection, my faith was not in the veracity of any one quiz, but rather in the statistical Law of Large Numbers. My sample mean was 52% YES. Throughout this process, I learned many digested facts about body language. Although Manny never touched me, he did laugh at all of my jokes, and sometimes his gaze drifted towards my mouth as I spoke. Agonizingly, this usually means that &amp;ldquo;they might like you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here is how I knew that he liked me for sure. On Sports Day in April, we had an extended lunch. We were in the same faction, the only two unpopular kids in our randomly-assigned group. We walked together to the gas station Tim Hortons: I got a chicken wrap, and Man got an Iced Capp. He practically fucking said it to me right then.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“I’m so tired from today,” he began.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“Same, I mean I don’t really ‘work out’ so like-“&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“Oh yeah, well, I kind of meant having to talk to all those random people?” Our eyes met in a flash of connection. He continued.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“It’s just so hard to ‘small talk’, but it’s worse when you don’t talk at all, but everything I say&amp;hellip;” All I did was nod. To be crystal clear, there was no prompting here. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;But then he trailed off, looked into my open eyes, and said, “But I feel so comfortable with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck, man! It destroys me every time. I loved him, and it was so clear that he loved me too. He had to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to the worst part. When we were in Grade 10, we sat on the edge of the classroom for Math 20-1, close to the northern door. (Manny might mention that the dash one indicates the rigor of this challenging course.) Hannah was gone today, and I managed to sit with Man, alone. He seemed tired; he was darker than usual. But today was a special day, and I had to proceed with the operation. I opened the New Album on my phone, pretended to laugh at a &lt;code&gt;MEME&lt;/code&gt;, and thrusted my phone out expectantly (you know the drill, Manny). He looked up and squinted, but his face remained slack.&lt;br&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;indent&#34;&gt;“Oh, haha.” He looked back down at his lined paper, but didn’t write anything. &lt;br&gt;
What? I only had one more buffer before the big drop, and it evoked an equally tepid response. I hurriedly swiped past it and forced my hands onto the desk so as to stop them from shaking as his dark eyes jumped across the screen: the last photo in the album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I LIKE YOU

BOTTOM TEXT 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manny shifted in his seat, stiff and small. “Oh,” he said, for the second time. (Maybe try using words instead of letters, Man. (I didn’t actually say that.)) I realized suddenly that I was smiling like a coyote and closed my lips. His cowlick bobbed, and he inspected the metal deskfeet, and then started to pick at his fingers. “Sorry,” he said next, which was at least a word. “I’m not, uh, I&amp;ndash;“ he finally met my eyes. “I don’t know if I really feel the same way.” His eyes slipped away in the middle of the word “same.” I knew exactly what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; felt in that moment. Manny, gathering his assignments and notebooks into a fabric binder, stumbled over the molded chairs and left the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the last I ever saw of Manny. Well, basically. More accurately, that was that last I ever heard of him. Since that nightmarish block nine weeks ago, Manny has not said a word to me. I suppose he has made eye contact once, by accident. I made a particularly loud joke during a shared Bio 20 block, which caused his eyes to catch onto mine as our classmates crowded around the overhead projector. His eyes were still dark and full of light. I searched for hatred but found only detached curiosity, and perhaps tender pity. What a fucking joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, maybe that explains Manny to you. According to the field of psychology, repeated, short interactions between individuals can create a stronger sense of familiarity than intermittent deep conversations. I think this is what happened between us. Somehow, inside or between all of these interactions, I learned who Man was. So if you want to know something less personal, here are a couple more things. He loved the taste of MSG, but rarely ate a proper lunch. If I took the blue sleeve off his eraser, he would slip it back on without a word. He was timid, but those little movements were always swift and assured. Just like me, he is sixteen years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(I think that we overvalue logical reasoning when it comes to measuring &#34;intelligence.&#34;)&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we mean by &lt;em&gt;intelligence&lt;/em&gt; in the context of cognitive science and AI? One thing that often comes to mind is logical reasoning: deriving conclusions from a set of axioms and rules, or thinking through syllogisms like &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;all cats are mammals, all mammals are warm-blooded, therefore all cats are warm-blooded.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, I thought of structured reasoning tasks as central to human (and by extension machine) intelligence. It seemed almost obvious that a &amp;ldquo;truly&amp;rdquo; intelligent system would encode abstract notions of, e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09612&#34;&gt;same versus different,&lt;/a&gt; and that such a system would have absolutely no trouble with syllogistic tasks. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is an unpopular opinion: critics of LLMs assert that logical tasks are &lt;a href=&#34;https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/llms-dont-do-formal-reasoning-and&#34;&gt;essential to &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; general intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Some go on to claim that this type of reasoning is fundamentally incompatible with probablistic next-token prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that abstract logical reasoning is quite as fundamental to human intelligence as it seems. In his 1982 work &lt;em&gt;Orality and Literacy&lt;/em&gt;, Walter Ong references a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl1.cuni.cz/pluginfile.php/738180/mod_resource/content/0/Luria%20-%20Cognitive-development-its-cultural-and-social-foundations.pdf&#34;&gt;book containing a series of interviews&lt;/a&gt; by A.R. Luria, a Soviet neuropsychologist who interviewed low-educated populations of peasants in the Uzbek SSR in 1931. The interviews were published over forty years later, in 1976, and are very interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one of the questions Luria asked people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Far North, where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is always snow there. What color are the bears?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, Luria found that illiterate respondents were very unlikely to simply respond &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; to this question. They ignored the constraints of the syllogism, and reasoned based on their own personal experiences instead. Here is an example of an exchange with a 37-year-old from a remote Kashgar village &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl1.cuni.cz/pluginfile.php/738180/mod_resource/content/0/Luria%20-%20Cognitive-development-its-cultural-and-social-foundations.pdf&#34;&gt;(Luria, 1976, pp. 109)&lt;/a&gt;, who refused to accept the premise of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Far North, where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is always snow there. What color are the bears?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There are different sorts of bears.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;(The syllogism is repeated.)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a black bear. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen any others&amp;hellip; each locality has its own animals: if it&amp;rsquo;s white, they will be white; if it&amp;rsquo;s yellow, they will be yellow.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;But what kind of bears are there in Novaya Zemlya?&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We always speak only of what we see, we don&amp;rsquo;t talk about what we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;But what do my words imply? (The syllogism is repeated.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s like this: our tsar isn&amp;rsquo;t like yours, and yours isn&amp;rsquo;t like ours. Your words can be answered only by someone who was there, and if a person wasn&amp;rsquo;t there he can&amp;rsquo;t say anything on the basis of your words.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luria presents illiterate Uzbeks with many more logical puzzles, which they also seem to reject. When shown drawings of an axe, a saw, a hatchet, and a log, and asked to choose the odd one out, a 25-year-old illiterate respondent said: &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re all alike. The saw will saw the log and the hatchet will chop it into small pieces. If one of these has to go, I&amp;rsquo;d throw out the hatchet. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t do as good a job as a saw.&amp;rdquo; Literate respondents, on the other hand, would almost always discard the log, with the rationale that the three tools should be grouped together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the underlying explanation for this behavior, I find these interview responses thrilling to read. There are a lot of hypotheses for why these people were so resistant to such logic-based tasks (e.g., Ong points out that peasants who had learned to write were more likely to entertain Luria&amp;rsquo;s syllogisms), but there is no reason to believe that regular people born in the Uzbek SSR and randomly selected for this study were any more or less &amp;ldquo;intelligent&amp;rdquo; than individuals drawn from some other population. Clearly, abstract reasoning tasks like deduction and categorization are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; universal across humans—and these Uzbek farmers were getting along just fine without much care for them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;some-sympathy&#34; &gt;Some Sympathy
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#some-sympathy&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To go back to the bear example, it&amp;rsquo;s not that people &lt;em&gt;couldn&amp;rsquo;t conceive&lt;/em&gt; of the abstract reasoning necessary to answer this problem &amp;ldquo;correctly.&amp;rdquo; After more back-and-forth in the above conversation, another young Uzbek chimed in, who was clearly able to complete the syllogistic reasoning presented in the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But on the basis of my words—in the North, where there is always snow, the bears are white, can you gather what kind of bears there are in Novaya Zemlya?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If a man was sixty or eighty and had seen a white bear and had told about it, he could be believed, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen one and hence I can&amp;rsquo;t say. That&amp;rsquo;s my last word. Those who saw can tell, and those who didn&amp;rsquo;t see can&amp;rsquo;t say anything!&amp;rdquo; (At this point a young Uzbek volunteered, &amp;ldquo;From your words it means that bears there are white.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Well, which of you is right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What the cock knows how to do, he does. What I know, I say, and nothing beyond that!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the transcripts of these interviews, it seems to me that these questions are just frustratingly uninteresting to the interviewed subjects, who were not used to contrived tests of formal reasoning in classroom settings. It&amp;rsquo;s not unreasonable to respond this way if you aren&amp;rsquo;t used to separating a word problem from the world that it is embedded in (sequestering it away in a little &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)&#34;&gt;closure&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example that might make you more sympathetic to the Uzbek nomads. What valid inference can you make based on the following statements (&lt;a href=&#34;https://modeltheory.org/papers/1989suppression.pdf&#34;&gt;Byrne, 1989&lt;/a&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- http://repo.darmajaya.ac.id/4379/1/Computational%20logic%20and%20human%20thinking%20_%20how%20to%20be%20artificially%20intelligent%20%28%20PDFDrive%20%29.pdf
https://modeltheory.org/papers/1989suppression.pdf --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Amy has an essay to write, she will study late in the library.
&lt;br&gt; If the library is open, Amy will study late in the library. &lt;br&gt; Amy has an essay to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you are supposed to reason logically within the confines of these three sentences, which translated into symbols, say: $P\rightarrow Q$, $M\rightarrow Q$, $P$. Operating logically, I know that I can conclude $Q$. But personally, I find it very hard to conclude that &amp;ldquo;Amy will study late in the library&amp;rdquo; without knowing whether the library is open. There is an obvious &lt;em&gt;modus ponens&lt;/em&gt; here, but I just cannot make myself believe it. Others agree: 62% of respondents in Byrne&amp;rsquo;s original study made the same &amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo; that I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So—if you agree with me that we can&amp;rsquo;t conclude whether Amy will study late unless we know the closing hours of the library she plans to study at, then maybe you can understand the indignation of the 37-year-old Uzbek when asked whether bears in Novaya Zemlya are white. When situated in a real life scenario, it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to reason in this way. Suspending all external world knowledge and understanding to complete a word problem just feels inane. We are used to suspending our disbelief when it comes to classic syllogisms, but once the reasoning hits a little closer to home, a lot of us end up reacting just like Luria&amp;rsquo;s interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quick-conclusion&#34; &gt;Quick Conclusion
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#quick-conclusion&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is the skill of suspending disbelief in order to activate particular logical processes, given a particular type of question, a good indicator of general intelligence? Maybe our focus on &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo; is myopic in and of itself. In &lt;em&gt;Orality and Literacy&lt;/em&gt;, Ong notes that people from many oral cultures do not think of individuals as being &amp;ldquo;intelligent&amp;rdquo; in general. If someone is a good navigator, they are a good navigator. If they are a dancer or storyteller, they are lauded for those abilities. Why would you need some underlying g-factor to tie all of these traits together? And in the case of IQ testing, why would shape rotation and syllogism questions be uniquely suited to measure that factor, if it even exists? Even ignoring the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#IQ_testing_and_the_eugenics_movement_in_the_United_States&#34;&gt;dark history of IQ testing&lt;/a&gt;, I think that this perspective is rigid and unhelpful. There is so much more to the human mind beyond formal logic and sterile test questions; arguably, the beauty of artificial and natural thought comes from its inconsistencies, illogical leaps, and unconscious intuitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Ironically, I&#39;m now suspicious of the word &#34;intelligence&#34; in AI research when it refers to these narrow abstract reasoning tasks. Not just because of pedantic nitpicking, not just because of the , but because I simply think it&#39;s a really narrow view of the human mind, which makes it unhelpful for our purposes as AI researchers. Maybe we should think bigger about what exactly we mean by *intelligence* other than pointing to these types of structured tasks, especially if our purported goal is to build intelligent systems.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- 
The word problems in this anecdote are clearly reminiscent of how we measure IQ in intelligence testing. One conclusion that you might draw from this is that if illiterate people are less good at  --&gt;
