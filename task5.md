Please read the following passage, taken from an online forum. (5/5)

{: .quote}
Even though crack cocaine has been banned for years, it is still more popular everywhere than marijuana. The cops could make it easier on themselves by targeting the crack dealers with their vast number of informants, but they don't. So, it's much easier to target the big time drug dealer than to go after "the little guys." If you want more arrests, you can do it, but you’ll have to work harder to catch people with less, and if you do that, you’ll have more satisfying arrests. This is easier, but it doesn't support the racist policy that no one can say is racist.
