<h2 id="writing-thats-not-language-yet">writing that’s not language (yet)</h2>
<p>An <a href="/rereading">interactive essay</a> I worked on for Rereading Writing (LITR1231E) in Summer 2021 with Prof. John Cayley. Explores how humans ascribe meaning to text generated by machines, and how state-of-the-art NLP models push the boundaries of what we can comfortably call language.

<h2 id="two-sentence-horror-story-generator">two-sentence horror story generator</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://github.com/sfeucht/bart_horror">simple BART model</a> fine-tuned to generate two-sentence horror stories. It also has a <a href="https://twitter.com/BartHorror">Twitter page</a> (which is currently not active)!

<h2 id="surreal-spaces-a-series">surreal spaces (a series)</h2>
<p><a href="/studioart">Selections</a> from my concentration for my A.P. Studio Art portfolio. I was interested in creating somewhat dreamlike illustrations of different settings, drawing from my own personal experiences.

<h2 id="jazz-drumming">jazz drumming</h2>
<p>I’ve started to be involved in jazz as a drummer at Brown, informally among friends as well as in the school-organized combos. You can find recordings of our concerts here: &lt;&gt;summer 2021</p>
