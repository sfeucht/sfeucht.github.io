I"Ê<p>The following five texts have been selected from a large corpus that was created by cognitive scientists in order to study different approaches to <b>argumentation</b>.</p>

<p>Each of these documents is a randomly-sampled comment from an online forum in which users discuss legalization of cannabis and other drugs.</p>

<p>These documents vary in terms of coherence: many are badly written and difficult to understand, and would be rated as having low argument quality.</p>

<p>Please read and respond to each of these five texts as you see fit. There are some questions to guide you.</p>
