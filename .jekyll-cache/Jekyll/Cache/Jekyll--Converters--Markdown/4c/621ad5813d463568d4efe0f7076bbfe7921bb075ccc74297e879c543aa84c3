<p class="quote">Again, to be clear, I think we should have laws against hard drugs, but the punishment for simple possession of methamphetamine, cocaine and heroin is a bit much. As long as you can produce good performance at work, can function in your social life, you should be free to do whatever you like on your own time as long as you aren’t bothering anyone else?</p>
