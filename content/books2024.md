# Books I Read in 2024

Here are the books that I remember reading this year. I don't set "reading goals" for myself, but this year a lot of interesting books fell into my lap. I even managed to have time to read many of them! 

- East, West - Salman Rushdie
- If This Is a Man - Primo Levi
- How to Do Things with Words - JL Austin
- Lolita - Vladimir Nabokov
- Seeing Further - Esther Kinsky
- The Empusium - Olga Tokarczuk 
- Childish Literature - Alejandro Zambra 
- The Ways of Paradise - Peter Cornell 
- Attached - Amir Levine and Rachel S. F. Heller 


<!-- ### East, West - Salman Rushdie.

My partner Adrian bought this from a bin in Harvard Square. I found it delightful, and will be looking for more Salman Rushdie in the future. 

**If This Is a Man - Primo Levi.** Lent to me by my friend Raj. 

**How to do things with words - JL Austin.** Lent to me by my advisor David. Makes me want to read Judith Butler. 

**Lolita - Nabokov.** One of the best novels I've read so far, ever. 

**Seeing Further - Esther Kinsky.** Gift from my partner (first book from a Fitzcarraldo Editions subscription). 

**The Empusium - Olga Tokarczuk.** 

**Childish Literature - Alejandro Zambra.**

**The Ways of Paradise - Peter Cornell.**

**Attached - Amir Levine and Rachel S. F. Heller.**  -->

## Unfinished

- 3 Shades of Blue: Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, and the Lost Empire of Cool - James Kaplan
